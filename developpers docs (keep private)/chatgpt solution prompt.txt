I have an encrypted image file that appears to be visual noise, and I need to decrypt it using the key "LEAVE". The encryption method used is AES in CTR mode (AES-CTR). The encrypted image retains the same dimensions as the original. Hereâ€™s what I need help with:

Key Derivation: Use "LEAVE" to derive a 16-byte AES key. You can use SHA-256 to hash "LEAVE" and then truncate it to the first 16 bytes.
Decrypt the Image:
Load the encrypted image file and convert it to a flat array of pixel data.
Initialize AES-CTR using the derived key and a counter of 128 bits.
Perform XOR between the pixel data and the stream generated by AES-CTR to decrypt the image data.
Reconstruct the Image: Once decrypted, reshape the flat array back into its original image dimensions and save the decrypted image.
The output should be the decrypted image, where the hidden text or flag is revealed.
