For educational purposes only, the creator isn't responsible for the miss-use of this folder

This is a cryptographic ctf challenge based on a very popular mistery online that mixes steganography, cryptography, deception and a bit of my own creativity.
In order to solve it you can try it and have fun, follow the developpers folder steps or find out in what popular challenge this was based ;) Good luck.
Flag format is 'HHCTF{#####}'.

Folder description

- challenge 				 (folder with documents for the CTF that the concursants can see).

	- everywhere_mean_something.docx (CTF concursants must be able to download this document).
	- everywhere.png 		 (Ctf concursants must be able to see a preview and download this picture WITH NO COMPRESION).

- developpers docs (keep private) 	 (Documents to keep private for ctf developers).

	- solution.docx			 (technical explanation to resolve the challenge).
	- quick_prompt_solution		 (chatgpt prompt to quickly solve the challenge with the precut_cyphered_image). >>> Booooring :(
	- precut_cyphered_image.png	 (pre-cut cyphered image with the flag inside).
	- precut_cyphered_image_ICOE.png (ICOE in case of emergency. This image has a second hidden message at the end of the binary just as everywhere.png, only usable if no one manage to cut the picture without corrupting the pixels during the first hour of the ctf).
